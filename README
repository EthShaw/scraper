Readme file for FIRSTmap scraper #2

This scraper is likely to be a high-maintenance item, as there are a number
    of hacks to work around incomplete team info from thebluealliance, and
    differences between place names in different databases.  To use this,
    copy/extract the files to a directory, get an api key from
    thebluealliance.com and store it in TBA-auth, then run "./get_all_data"
